This project is a plant classification tool built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model,
leveraging the MobileNet architecture for efficient image classification. The tool allows users to upload an image of a plant, 
which the trained model then processes to predict the plant's species. The model is trained on a custom dataset of various plants, 
and the user interface is built with Streamlit to provide an intuitive experience.
